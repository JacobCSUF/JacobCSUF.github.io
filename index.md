### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8 interested me greatly as I could read input and write output from a file. In part 1, I read input from a text file with over 60,000 words and found any existing palindromes. In addition to learning about file I/O, this lab taught me how good computers are at quickly handling small tedious tasks like looping through 60,000 words in less than a second. 

* Lab 11
     
     In Lab 11, I learned a lot about the uses of multiple source files. From a consumer perspective, it makes sense to have a .h file with just the function declarations that are easy to understand. In addition, I also learned how much more productive classes could be when writing more extended code. Instead of repeatedly declaring three separate variables in part 1, I could just call the State class, which is much more efficient. 
 
* Lab 12
    
    Lab 12 was one of my favorite labs because I got to see how animated images were made using the GraphicsMagick library. Specifically, In part 2, I used a pseudo-random number generator and nested for-loops to set each pixel to a random color. Along with this, a vector of images is created to make the animation work.
